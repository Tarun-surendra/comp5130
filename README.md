i have learned css, html, java script, mongodb, ExpressJS, React. with those i created a web application on auto motive service to access easily to get car services.

Issues:

Faced issues with library when we adjusting the css for the some of the buttons.
and i upgraded the library and used divs for solving the issue.

I faced some issues while i was creating the data base. and i solved the issue using this two properties with mongodb connection useNewUrlParser,useUnifiedTopology.
and  i faced many minor issue on setting up off reactjs and expressjs but i cleared and learned so many while solving.

I have to improve quote page to look and free.
